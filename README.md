# USBLoaderGX-Autogen-Categories
A poorly coded python script to auto-generate game categories from a WiiTDB.xml file

## Dependencies
Python 3: `pip install --upgrade lxml untangle`

## How to use
Put a copy of WiiTDB.xml in the same folder as the script, run the script, and copy over the newly created `GXGameCategories.xml` to `..\apps\usbloader_gx`
